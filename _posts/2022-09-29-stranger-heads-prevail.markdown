## Overview
"Stranger Heads Prevail" is Thank You Scientist's second full length album, released two years after "Maps of Non-Existent Places". Unlike its predecessor, this release has almost no subpar tracks, while also retaining the intense sound created by distorted guitar riffs and powerful percussion. Perhaps the most noticeable difference between this album and their previous one, is how well the vocals blend with the instrumental, while still staying dominant.

## General Thoughts
"Stranger Heads Prevail" mixes rock, jazz, and even metal, into one intricate contraption, where each cog, while different from the last, keeps the same sound and atmosphere. Going from track to track you can always know what to expect, yet still be surprised by the variations in rhythm and tone. There are no moments where song to song transitions feel awkward or forced, the whole album flows as a whole. With the exception of the epilogue, each piece has enough merit as a standalone song, to be memorable outside of the context of the project, though some songs may need time to grow on you, as they did on me.

## What I Like
It's hard to get bored when listening to this album; every song here is fast paced, has a catchy chorus, and the verses/solos are complex enough to keep your attention, even with how long the whole experience is. What really surprised me when I first listened through this album, is the prologue - a song you would usually expect to be a short introduction to the album, here also fills the role of a full, proper song, even if it's a little short. Tracks from "The Somnambulist" to "A Wolf in Cheap Clothing" are what I consider to be the best  part of this album, with no flaws I could point out; the next two tracks however are the weakest, with "Need More Input" being the worse of the two (even though I still find it much more interesting than "Blue Automatic"). Immediately after, we hear "Rube Goldberg Variations", the ""resident instrumental track"" of a Thank You Scientist album (as they include at least one in each full-length project) and I have to say that it's one of the best they ever made. It goes on for almost nine minutes, and includes a solo each for the trumpet, violin(?) and guitar respectively. Soon after the album closes out with "Psychopomp" into "Amateur Arsonist's Handbook" - both very powerful in both meaning and sound. If the album ended here, I would probably feel comfortable giving it a rating closer to a 10, but my dislike for the epilogue is too strong to allow me to do that. 

## What I Dislike
"Blue Automatic" and "Need More Input" are a huge weak point of the album, though if the rest of the songs didn't set the bar so incredibly high, they would be just fine. The Epilogue also annoys me more than I care to admit. Although it's just an epilogue, and unlike the prologue it doesn't try to be its own song, it still completely ruins the atmosphere established by "Amateur Arsonist's Handbook", which would work perfectly as a closing track if the epilogue wasn't there. It starts by repeating a line from "Amateur Arsonist's Handbook"'s chorus, making the whole epilogue sound like it's mocking the song, before it breaks into a whimsical, corny parody of the prologue, trivialising the serious tone of the preceding two tracks. The section from 0:40s onwards (the remaining 26 seconds of the epilogue), is the only redeeming quality of this track, and if this segment was all the epilogue was, it would've been far better.  

## Conclusion
"Stranger Heads Prevail" is not a perfect album - if the three weakest tracks (including the epilogue) were removed, it would possibly be what I would consider a perfect album, or as perfect as you can expect from a creation born from a human mind. All other songs on this album are behemoths in terms of quality, creativity and execution, and will be remembered for years to come. A fusion of jazz, rock and metal will most likely forever be doomed to relative obscurity, enjoyed only in its niche; though that doesn't mean it can't gain more recognition: through recommendations, masterpieces of the genre such as this album, can be shared to new listeners, who might find they like it despite their earlier reservations.   
In conclusion: I recommend you to give "Thank You Scientist" a try, as all of their other releases (maybe except "Plague Acommodations") are just as good, and show what progressive rock has to offer at its best.
